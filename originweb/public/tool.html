      <h2>Diigo</h2>
       this is another great bookmarking and annotating web service. It allows users to save a web page and 
       annotate it the way they want via adding comments in text boxes or highlighting important parts. It 
       also has a social ingredient in it in that users can share their annotated content with each other.

<h2>Awesome Screenshot</h2>
<p>This is one of my favourites. It is a chrome and Safari extension that allows 
users to capture screenshots of their webpage and then draw on them lines, annotate them,
 add text and comments, and share them with others. If you are a Chrome or Safari user then 
 this is indispensable.</p>

<h2>Bounce</h2>
<p>This is also a great annotating tool. It is very easy to use. Just type in the URL of
     a webpage and Bounce will then create an image of it allowing you thus to add text 
     and annotate it.You will also be able to share your annotated content via a unique URL.</p>

 <h2>Markup.io</h2>
<p>This is mainly a bookmarklet that you can drag and drop onto your browser
     toolbar. Once there you can then very easily annotate any webpage you are 
     viewing by simply clicking on that bookmarklet. Again when you finsih adding
      amd drawing on your webpage you can share it with others via a generated URL.</p>

<h2>Screen Draw</h2>
<p>This is an awesome extension from Firefox that allows users to annotate their 
    selected webpages. Users can  circle elements, type in notes, or draw on any 
    webpage they want before saving the annotated work as PNG or JPG files.</p>
